The System is for a guitar shop. And we made it as 3 categories as bellow mentioned,
1. Electric (5)
i. Electric Buy
2. Acoustic (5)
i. Acoustic Buy
3. Accessories (5)
i. Accessories Buy
And customer can purchase those instruments from our system. And we add a 
sign-up option as well. There user can add her/his details add create an account if you 
need, or else user can continue without an account and refer the details of the 
instruments. And u can view your details as well from data grid view. And if u want to 
delete your account you can delete and update as well. If it’s successful user will display 
a successful message. And users contact number is the primary key of our database. From 
grid view you can go through the home page. From home page user can visit all the pages 
that I mentioned top of the paragraph. (Ex: - Electric, Acoustic, Accessories) from each of 
the labeled instrument page user can see a button called “Buy” from that button user will 
visit the total cost of the instrument that user selected. So, after you can click button 
called “Check Out” then you will receive the receipt page with a purchase message. And 
there you can Contact Us page as well. From that page user can get all the contact details 
of shop owner and shop. And we used buttons for next page and back also.
